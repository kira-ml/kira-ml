## 🧠 About Me

I'm a Computer Science undergraduate deeply specializing in **Machine Learning**, with a focused research interest in **Natural Language Processing** and **Deep Learning**. My journey into AI began with the transformative rise of large language models, which sparked my fascination with how machines learn to represent, understand, and generate human language.

I maintain a **builder-researcher mindset**—constantly experimenting with new architectures and techniques while grounding my work in fundamental principles of linguistics, representation learning, and model mechanics.

## 📈 Current Exploration

I'm currently deepening my understanding in:

- **Architecture Mechanics**: How transformer components learn linguistic representations
- **Efficient NLP**: Model compression, knowledge distillation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- **Evaluation Methods**: Robust metrics for language model performance beyond accuracy
- **Semantic Search**: Dense retrieval systems and their applications in knowledge-intensive tasks

## 🌟 Aspirations

My long-term vision is to contribute to AI systems that genuinely understand and reason with language—moving beyond pattern recognition toward true language comprehension. I'm particularly interested in how we can build models that are not just statistically impressive but semantically grounded and interpretable.

I believe the next frontier in NLP lies in bridging the gap between human linguistic cognition and machine representation learning.
